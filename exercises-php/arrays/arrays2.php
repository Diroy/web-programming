/*
Given an array of integers as parameter, find and output the mean and the 
median of the parameter array.
- The mean is the average of the numbers. 
- The median can be found by sorting the numbers and picking the middle one 
  (e.g., the median of {3, 3, 5, 9, 11} is 5). If there is an even number of 
  numbers, then there is no single middle value; the median is then computed as 
  the mean of the two middle values (the median of {1, 5, 7, 9} 
  is (5 + 7) / 2 = 6).

For example,
	$numbers = array(1, 5, 7, 9);
	meanAndMedian($numbers);
should output
	mean =  5.5
	median = 6 
*/

$numbers = array(1, 5, 7, 9);

function meanAndMedian($numbers) {

	// THIS IS FOR YOU TO COMPLETE
	
} 

meanAndMedian($numbers);
